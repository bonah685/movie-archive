 <div class="textbox">  Fell in love with this movie as a kid. It was a fun 
    movie about animals on an adventure! 
        Fell in love with it again as an adult. Only Wes Anderson can 
    create a masterpiece directed towards a youngeraudience that 
    flawlessly tells a story about class warfare and many more real issues 
    that are all too real.</div>
    <div class="blob"></div>
<div class="subhead"> Thank you Wes, This movie is so wonderful</div>

 <div class="textbox2"> I would do anything to be anne-marie; she's always
     in the nude tanning with a book in her hands and i'm guessing she gets paid to do so.
    I love this movie and in turn it has caused me to gain more and more appreciation 
    for the genius that Wes Anderson is. Long live Bill Murray </div>

 <div class="textbox3">  I think Wes Anderson is a genius of our time and his work always amazes me. I saw this in theaters and immediately rewatched it the second it was available to stream online. The different stories and people are interesting to follow, 
    and the visuals are great, just like any other Anderson film.</div>
